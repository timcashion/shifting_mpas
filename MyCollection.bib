This study scrutinises the applicability of a discrete choice experiment to value the expected beneﬁts arising from the conservation of an offshore sandbank in UK waters. The valuation scenario refers to the UK part of the Dogger Bank, in the southern North Sea, and is based on real-world management options for ﬁsheries, wind farms and marine protection currently under discussion for the site. It is assessed to what extent the general public perceive and value conservation beneﬁts arising from an offshore marine protected area. The survey reveals support for marine conservation measures despite the general public's limited prior knowledge of current marine planning. Results further show signiﬁcant values for an increase in species diversity, the protection of certain charismatic species and a restriction in the spread of invasive species across the site. Implications for policy and management with respect to commercial ﬁshing, wind farm construction and nature conservation are discussed.},

We used available biological and economic data for an overexploited population of the leopard grouper (Mycteroperca rosacea) to study if closing parts of the population to fishing would allow sustainable use and maximum economic benefits. Our results suggest that fishing should be closed in all spawning areas and in at least 50\% of the adjacent areas. High non-consumptive benefits would be achieved with large closures because the abundance of the leopard groupers, which is an important attribute for SCUBA divers, would increase. In a no-take reserve, the welfare gains of divers seemingly could compensate for losses incurred by fishers if parts of their fishing grounds are closed. An adaptive management scheme could provide a way to incorporate newly available information into management decisions for the no-take reserve.},

UK Governments are currently establishing a network of marine protected areas (MPAs) informed by ecological data and socio-economic evidence. Evidence on CES values is needed, but only limited data have been available. We present a case study from the UK National Ecosystem Assessment (NEA) follow-on phase that elicited divers’ and anglers’ willingness to pay (WTP) for potential MPAs. The case study is an innovative combination of a travel-cost based choice experiment and an attribute-based contingent valuation method. Our study design allowed us to understand the marine users’ preferences from both a user and a stewardship perspective. Following the UK NEA’s placebased CES framework, we characterised marine CES as environmental spaces that might be protected, with features including the underwater seascape, and iconic and non-iconic species. Our survey highlighted the importance of CES to divers and anglers. A wide variety of marine spaces inﬂuenced user-WTP, while stewardship-WTP was most inﬂuenced by management restrictions, species protection, and attitudes towards marine conservation. An understanding of key stakeholders’ CES values can inform a more holistic and sustainable approach to marine management, especially for decisions involving trade-offs between marine protection and opportunity costs of the blue economy.},

This ex ante analysis was undertaken as part of a cost–beneﬁt evidence base to inform implementation of the proposed UK Marine and Coastal Access Bill. This Bill is part of an ambitious plan to designate and manage UK marine areas using an Ecosystems Approach. Beneﬁts are measured in terms of anticipated increases in the value of ecosystem goods and services provisioned by MCZs relative to the counterfactual, i.e. no designation. The principal valuation and thus policy challenge is presented by the need to use beneﬁts transfer in a context where biophysical provisioning functions are not well-developed, where there are gaps in the valuation literature related to temperate marine ecosystem goods and services, and where values (where available) are presented in aggregate terms. This paper develops and applies a methodology that ﬁrst apportions these aggregate beneﬁts across the diverse range of marine landscapes and habitats and then estimates the marginal beneﬁt of protection. The value of beneﬁts was calculated for three different conﬁgurations of MCZs under two different management regimes. We estimate a beneﬁt range from designation of between £10.2 billion and £23.5 billion in present value terms, applying a 3.5\% discount rate. The study questions the extent to which a defensible policy evidence base can be developed in the absence of primary valuation data and where beneﬁt estimates are reported in aggregate terms.},

In May 2009, we surveyed a random sample of U.S. households. We collected data from 8476 households and estimated willingness to pay for recovering and downlisting the 8 species from these data. Respondents were willing to pay for recovering and downlisting threatened and endangered marine taxa. Willingness-to-pay values ranged from \$40/household for recovering Puget Sound Chinook salmon to \$73/household for recovering the North Pacific right whale. Statistical comparisons among willingness-to-pay values suggest that some taxa are more economically valuable than others, which suggests that the U.S. public’s willingness to pay for recovery may vary by species.},

In addition, attitudinal and motivational data are related to respondents’ stated economic preferences. Three hundred interviews were conducted in the Seychelles during June 1998 and both tourists having visited a park and a more general population of tourists were surveyed. The results demonstrate that different economic values are predicted for respondents from different countries who display a range of both consumer and citizen behaviour in constructing their preferences. In addition, signiﬁcantly different WTP amounts are predicted depending on which particular marine parks are visited, and the expectations of visitors to Seychelles. The discussion focuses on exploring how this information may be of use to policy makers in setting a realistic pricing policy for visitors to Marine National Parks in the Seychelles.},

It supplies society with valuable ecosystem services, including the provision of food, the regeneration of nutrients and the sequestration of carbon. Technological advancements in the second half of the 20th century made large-scale exploitation of mineral, hydrocarbon and ﬁsh resources possible. These economic activities, combined with climate change impacts, constitute a considerable threat to deep-sea biodiversity. Many governments, including that of the UK, have therefore decided to implement additional protected areas in their waters of national jurisdiction. To support the decision process and to improve our understanding for the acceptance of marine conservation plans across the general public, a choice experiment survey asked Scottish households for their willingness-to-pay for additional marine protected areas in the Scottish deep-sea. This study is one of the ﬁrst to use valuation methodologies to investigate public preferences for the protection of deep-sea ecosystems. The experiment focused on the elicitation of economic values for two aspects of marine biodiversity: (i) the existence value for deep-sea species and (ii) the option value of deep-sea organisms as a source for future medicinal products.},

To help assess whether such values exceed the potential costs of MPAs, this paper provides a policy-enabling framework that reviews the existing theoretical and practical instruments and approaches that can be used in the ex-ante evaluation of MPAs. This framework is in three parts. First, a range of alternative monetary and non-monetary techniques to estimate three key economic beneﬁts of MPAs: consumptive, non-consumptive use and non-use values are presented. Second, three decision protocols that can be applied to determine the desirability of establishing MPAs are described. Third, caveats of these approaches and the necessity to accommodate social needs of the communities are provided. The framework shows that biological and ecological considerations together with economic viability and socio-economic factors can and should be taken into account when deciding about when and where to establish MPAs and of what size.},

Over ﬁve hundred tourist SCUBA divers were interviewed at seven sites across three Caribbean countries representing a diversity of individuals within the Caribbean dive market. A choice experiment was used to assess willingness to pay as a function of the abundance and size of reef ﬁshes, the presence of ﬁshing activity/gear, and dive price. Despite some preference heterogeneity both between and within sites, the results indicate that future declines in the abundance of reef ﬁshes, and particularly in the number of large ﬁshes observed on recreational dives, will result in signiﬁcant reductions in diver consumer surplus. On the other hand, improvements in ﬁsh populations and reduced ﬁshing gear encounters are likely to result in significant economic gains. These results can be used to justify investment in pre-emptive management strategies targeted at improving reef ﬁsh stocks (namely reducing unsustainable ﬁshing activities and land-based reef impacts), managing conﬂicting uses, as well as to indicate a possible source of ﬁnancing for such conservation activities.},

Despite considerable empirical evidence that abundance and biomass of ﬁshed species increase within marine reserve boundaries, the potential for reserves to provide ﬁsheries and conservation beneﬁts to adjacent waters remains heavily debated. This paper uses statistical and population models to evaluate published empirical data on adult spillover from marine reserves and shows that spillover is a common phenomenon for species that respond positively to reserve protection, but at relatively small scales, detectable on average up to 800 m from reserve boundaries. At these small scales, local ﬁsheries around reserves were likely unsustainable in 12 of 14 cases without the reserve, and spillover partially or fully offsets losses in catch due to reserve closure in the other two cases. For reserves to play a role in sustaining and replenishing larger-scale ﬁshed stocks, networks of reserves may be necessary, but as few exist this is difﬁcult to evaluate. The results suggest reserves can simultaneously meet conservation objectives and beneﬁt local ﬁsheries adjacent to their boundaries.},

It is recognized that adult and juvenile movement reduces the core beneﬁts of protected areas, namely protecting the full age–structure of marine populations, while at the same time perhaps improving ﬁsheries yield over the no-reserve situation through export of individuals from protected areas. Nevertheless, the study of the consequences of movement on protected area functioning is unbalanced. Signiﬁcant attention has been paid to the inﬂuence of certain movement patterns, such as diffusive movement and home ranges, while the impacts of others, such as density-dependent movements and ontogenetic migrations, have been relatively ignored. Here we review the diversity of density-independent and densitydependent movement patterns, as well as what is currently known about their consequences for the conservation and ﬁsheries effects of marine protected areas. We highlight a number of ‘partially addressed’ issues in marine protected area research, such as the effects of reserves targeting speciﬁc life phases, and a number of essentially unstudied issues, such as density-dependent movements, nomadism, ontogenetic migrations, behavioral polymorphism and ‘dynamic’ reserves that adjust location as a realtime response to habitat changes. Assessing these issues will be essential to creating effective marine protected area networks for mobile species and accurately assessing reserve impacts on these species.},

The most common approach is demand analysis, where demand equations are estimated either individually or in a system of demand equations. These studies of the demand structure focus on the price sensitivity of demand, on the degree of substitution between potentially competing products and on income/expenditure effects. However, as price information is often more available than quantity, there have been a number of market integration studies that primarily focus on the competition between different products. The purpose of this paper is to give a review of demand and market integration studies with respect to fish, focusing on the method used, the information that is obtained, and how this information varies with the approach used.},

Of these, a seed cell selection procedure works by evaluating potential cells for protection one by one, picking the one that maximizes the objective function, adding seed cells. This continues to full protection of the project area. The other is a Monte Carlo approach, which uses a likelihood sampling procedure based on weighted importance layers of conservation interest to evaluate alternative protected area sizing and placement. This is similar to the objective function of Marxan, a priority-selection decision-support tool based on optimization algorithms using geographic information system data. The two approaches are alternative options in a common spatial optimization module, which uses the time- and spatial-dynamic Ecospace model for the evaluations. The optimizations are implemented as components of the Ecopath with Ecosim approach and software. In a case study, we ﬁnd that there can be protected area zoning that will accommodate economical and social factors, without causing ecological deterioration. We also ﬁnd a tradeoff between including cells of special conservation interest, and the economic and social interests. While this does not need to be a general feature, it emphasizes the need to use modeling techniques to evaluate the tradeoff.},

	abstract = {Research toward the impacts of climate change and human activities on marine ecosystems is challenged by the limitations of present-day ecosystem models to address the interrelated spatial dynamics between climate, ocean chemistry, marine food webs, and human systems. The work presented here, the spatial–temporal data framework, is part of a larger study, the NF-UBC Nereus Program, to develop a new approach to model interoperability for closing the gap between marine ecosystem modeling tools via geographic information systems (GIS) technology. The approach we present simpliﬁes interdisciplinary model interoperability by separating technical and scientiﬁc challenges into a ﬂexible and modular software approach. To illustrate capabilities of the new framework, we use a remote-sensing derived spatial and temporal time series to drive the primary production dynamics in an existing food web model of the North-Central Adriatic using the Ecospace module of the Ecopath with Ecosim approach. In general, the predictive capabilities of the food web model to hind-cast ecosystem dynamics are enhanced when applying the new framework by better reﬂecting observed species population trends and distributions. Results show that changes at the phytoplankton level due to changes in primary production are realistically reproduced and cascade up the pelagic food web. The dynamics of zooplankton and small and large pelagic ﬁsh are impacted. Highly exploited demersal species such as European hake do, however, not show clear signs of cascading. This may be due to the high ﬁshing pressure on this species and the resulting strong historical decline in the area. In general, the development of the new framework offers ecosystem modelers with unprecedented capabilities to include spatial–temporal time series into food web analysis with a minimal set of required steps. It is a promising step toward integrating species distribution models and food web dynamics, and future implementations of interdisciplinary model interoperability.},

Dynamic MPAs are MPAs with a range of dormant management responses that turn on only when conditions warrant them. This new tool has the potential to allow resource managers to respond to impending but highly uncertain future environmental harms, such as the effects of climate change, in a timely fashion without abridging existing public participation processes. The creation of a dynamic MPA would require careful integration of science, law, and policy. All dynamic MPAs as envisioned in this paper would have 3 components: 1.) management goals, 2.) substantive responses, and 3.) triggering indicators. This paper would apply the challenge of managing developing climate-driven mid-water hypoxia to the protection of an overexploited fish species in Southern California and creates a hypothetical dynamic MPA based on an existing MPA.},

It has been suggested that variable spacing between reserves is essential to the success of a system of marine reserves. We used numerical models to examine the effect of variable spacing on the efficacy of marine reserves for managing a fish species with sedentary adults and planktonic larvae. Variability in reserve spacing affected catch and recruitment relative to values for a uniform configuration of reserves only for populations near collapse even in the presence of a system of reserves. For species with low fishing rates or large marine reserves, variability in spacing had only a minor effect. At high fishing rates and small reserve sizes, variable reserve placement had a positive local effect on catch and recruitment when several reserves fell close to each other. These configurations led to uneven spatial distributions with greater catch and recruitment in areas with a higher concentration of reserves. Variable reserve spacing can offer additional protection to overfished populations along certain sections of the coastline, but concern for spatial homogeneity will argue for a uniform distribution of reserves covering an adequate proportion of the entire coastline.},

Trawl nets or purse seine nets in a wide area are regulated in some offshore MPAs. In contrast, mobile MPAs that areas are not spatially fixed may be effective for migratory species like tunas. Recently a purse seine net fishery exploits Pacific bluefin tunas during the spawning season. Fisheries and spawning grounds often shift from year to year. Satellite data are probably useful to detect spawning ground for each year. I will discuss possibility of spatial design of MPAs to protect spawning ground of Pacific bluefin tunas and evaluate effects of such MPAs in the tuna stocks and fisheries.},

	abstract = {Extreme climatic events are expected to become more frequent under current conditions of increasing global temperatures and climate variability. A key challenge of ﬁsheries management is understanding and planning for the eﬀect of anomalous oceanic conditions on the distributions of protected species and their interactions with ﬁshing gear. Atypical marine states can cause non-target species to shift outside of their normal distribution patterns, leading to unwanted bycatch events that threaten ﬁsheries sustainability. Environmental indicators can serve as early warning signals that allow for proactive management responses before signiﬁcant bycatch occurs. Marine heatwaves in the Paciﬁc have caused shifts in the distributions of endangered loggerhead turtles (Caretta caretta), increasing overlap with California’s Drift Gillnet ﬁshery and thereby the risk of turtle bycatch events. To reduce bycatch, a ﬁshery closure oﬀshore of Southern California – The Loggerhead Conservation Area – Is enacted when an El Niño event has been declared and local sea surface temperatures (SSTs) are warmer than normal. However, this regulation was based on qualitative assessment of bycatch that occurred during past El Niño events, and no explicit threshold for SST anomalies was deﬁned. Additionally, closures enacted under the current regulation rely on structured expert decision-making. Providing a quantitative indicator could help to reﬁne future decisions. We developed and evaluated potential new indicators to guide the Loggerhead Conservation Area closure timing based on thermal indices in three diﬀerent regions: the equatorial Paciﬁc, regional areas oﬀshore of Southern California, and temperate pelagic areas oﬀ the US west coast. Our objectives were to: 1) quantify thermal indicators and their respective thresholds to guide closure timing, and 2) hindcast closure scenarios based on these indicator thresholds to evaluate eﬃcacy in terms of opportunity costs to ﬁshers and ability to avoid turtle interactions. The best indicator in terms of avoiding historical turtle interactions while minimizing opportunity cost to ﬁshers was a six-month average local SST anomaly indicator with closures enacted above a threshold of 0.77 °C. This result can improve upon the current closure guidelines by providing a quantiﬁed and spatially-explicit indicator and threshold to supplement the structured decision-making process. Our analysis demonstrates a novel approach to developing ﬁsheries management strategies for species with a paucity of data. Issues with data comprehensiveness are frequently present in ﬁsheries management exercises, and precautionary approaches are needed to allow adherence with legislation while considering the best available science.},

	abstract = {Marine Protected Areas are usually static, permanently closed areas. There are, however, both social and ecological reasons to adopt dynamic closures, where reserves move through time. Using a general theoretical framework, we investigate whether dynamic closures can improve the mean biomass of herbivorous ﬁshes on reef systems, thereby enhancing resilience to undesirable phase-shifts. At current levels of reservation (10–30\%), moving protection between all reefs in a system is unlikely to improve herbivore biomass, but can lead to a more even distribution of biomass. However, if protected areas are rotated among an appropriate subset of the entire reef system (e.g. rotating 10 protected areas between only 20 reefs in a 100 reef system), dynamic closures always lead to increased mean herbivore biomass. The management strategy that will achieve the highest mean herbivore biomass depends on both the trajectories and rates of population recovery and decline. Given the current large-scale threats to coral reefs, the ability of dynamic marine protected areas to achieve conservation goals deserves more attention.},

We investigated the extent to which connectivity and climate change have been considered in an ecologically meaningful way in marine conservation planning, as an attempt to help formulate conservation objectives for population persistence, over and above representation. Our review of the literature identiﬁed 115 marine planning studies that addressed connectivity and 47 that addressed the effects of climate change. Of the statements identiﬁed that related to goals and objectives, few were quantitative and justiﬁed by ecological evidence for either connectivity (13\%) or climate change (8.9\%). Most studies addressing connectivity focused on spatial design (e.g. size and spacing) of marine protected areas (MPAs) or clustering of planning units. Climate change recommendations were primarily based on features related to MPA placement (e.g. preferences for areas relatively resilient and resistant to climate change impacts). Quantitative methods to identify spatial or temporal dynamics of features related to connectivity and/or climate change (e.g. functionally well-connected or thermal refugia areas) were rare, and these accounted for the majority of ecologically justiﬁed statements. Given these shortcomings in the literature, we outline a framework for setting marine conservation planning objectives that describes six key approaches to more effectively integrate connectivity and climate change into conservation plans, aligning opportunities and minimizing trade-offs between both issues.},

	abstract = {Climate change is impacting upon global marine ecosystems and ocean wide changes in ecosystem properties are expected to continue. Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) have been implemented as a conservation tool throughout the world, primarily as a measure to reduce local impacts, but their usefulness and effectiveness is strongly related to climate change. MPAs may have a role in mitigation through effects on carbon sequestration, affect interactions between climatic effects and other drivers and be affected themselves as the distributions of protected species change over time. However, to date, few MPA programmes have directly considered climate change in the design, management or monitoring of an MPA network. This paper presents a series of international case studies from four locations: British Columbia, Canada; central California, USA; the Great Barrier Reef, Australia and the Hauraki Gulf, New Zealand; to review perceptions of how climate change has been considered in the design, implementation, management and monitoring of MPAs. The results indicate that some MPA processes have already incorporated design criteria or principles for adaptive management, which address some of the potential impacts of climate change on MPAs. Key lessons include: i) Strictly protected marine reserves are considered essential for climate change resilience and will be necessary as scientiﬁc reference sites to understand climate change effects ii) Adaptive management of MPA networks is important but hard to implement iii) Strictly protected reserves managed as ecosystems are the best option for an uncertain future. Although the case studies addressed aspects of considering climate change within MPA networks and provided key lessons for the practical inclusion of these considerations, there are some signiﬁcant challenges remaining. This paper provides new insights into the policy and practical challenges MPA managers face under climate change scenarios.},

	abstract = {Globally, the number of recreational fishers is sizeable and increasing in many countries. Associated with this trend is the potential for negative impacts on fish stocks through exploitation or management measures such as stocking and introduction of non-native fishes. Nevertheless, recreational fishers can be instrumental in successful fisheries conservation through active involvement in, or initiation of, conservation projects to reduce both direct and external stressors contributing to fishery declines. Understanding fishers’ concerns for sustained access to the resource and developing methods for their meaningful participation can have positive impacts on conservation efforts. We examined a suite of case studies that demonstrate successful involvement of recreational fishers in conservation and management activities that span developed and developing countries, temperate and tropical regions, marine and freshwater systems, and open- and closedaccess fisheries. To illustrate potential benefits and challenges of involving recreational fishers in fisheries management and conservation, we examined the socioeconomic and ecological contexts of each case study. We devised a conceptual framework for the engagement of recreational fishers that targets particular types of involvement (enforcement, advocacy, conservation, management design [type and location], research, and monitoring) on the basis of degree of stakeholder stewardship, scale of the fishery, and source of impacts (internal or external). These activities can be enhanced by incorporating local knowledge and traditions, taking advantage of leadership and regional networks, and creating collaborations among various stakeholder groups, scientists, and agencies to maximize the probability of recreational fisher involvement and project success.},

	abstract = {Regional efforts have increased the number and amount of marine protected areas (MPAs) in the Caribbean, yet few studies have examined how these MPAs are progressing toward their goals and objectives. Using social and ecological data from a rapid assessment of 31 MPAs and their associated human communities in the wider Caribbean, this study investigates (1) the stated social and ecological objectives of MPAs; (2) the extent to which MPAs are making progress toward their stated social and ecological objectives; and (3) tradeoffs in progress toward social and ecological objectives. Findings indicate that Caribbean MPAs have multiple objectives related to both social and ecological conditions, and that most MPAs are making at least some progress towards achieving these objectives. Those MPAs with stated objectives to promote education and serve as a model for other MPAs seem to be making good progress on these objectives, while those with the objective of reducing conﬂict are not. Where MPAs are not meeting their goals and objectives, planners and managers should consider reallocating human and ﬁnancial resources to address deﬁciencies and re-evaluating existing goals and objectives. It is important to consider how existing marine protected areas are performing as efforts in the Caribbean region and elsewhere continue to promote the establishment of new MPAs.},

Economic theory has a long history of evaluating tradeoffs in returns from different assets to identify optimal investment strategies. There has been recent progress applying this framework to the delivery of ecosystem services in land use planning. However, despite growing national and international interest in marine spatial planning, there is a lack of parallel frameworks in the marine realm. This paper reviews an ecosystem service tradeoff analysis framework and provides a more comprehensive synthesis for how it can be applied to marine spatial planning and marine ecosystem-based management. A tradeoff analysis approach can reveal inferior management options, demonstrate the beneﬁts of comprehensive planning for multiple, interacting services over managing single services, and identify ‘compatible’ services that provide win–win management options.},

	doi = {10.31230/osf.io/qf5tv},
	abstract = {Following the designation of the Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument in 2000, globally there has been a growing trend in establishing large, remote, no-take marine reserves (\&gt; 150,000 sq km), generally known as Large-Scale Marine Protected Areas (LSMPAs). Yet such MPAs with vast geographical areas bring design and management challenges, as the islands and seas are spread over hundreds of nautical miles and are largely inaccessible and often uninhabited. In order to understand how management of LSMPAs can be successfully sustained, this study evaluates the Pitcairn Islands Marine Reserve (PIMR), designated in September 2016, against a framework based on 10 criteria, which were derived from the IUCN WCPA's Guidelines for Design and Management of Large-Scale MPAs. Initial findings show the PIMR was satisfactory in design focusing on sound management practices, taking into account uncertainties around financial sustainability and future administrations. This study identifies the importance of: acquiring robust baseline data, being fully protected (no-take), using ecosystem-based management, community inclusion, and of adopting an ecologically connected network approach. These features are needed for large marine reserves to maximize achieving both ecological and socio-economic goals, with particular attention to engagement of local communities. This study opens the possibility of refining and adapting the criteria developed through the PIMR case study as starting point for other Large-Scale MPAs, as their global expansion could benefit from comparative analysis. It also acknowledges the importance of having comparative design and management guides, contributing towards globally recognized standards for large-scale MPAs.},

Ecosystems are places, so marine spatial planners and managers must understand the heterogeneity of biological communities and their key components (especially apex predators and structure-forming species), and of key processes (e.g., population connectivity, interaction webs, biogeochemistry) that maintain them, as well as heterogeneity of human uses. Maintaining resistance and resilience to stressors is crucial. Because marine populations and ecosystems exhibit complex system behaviors, managers cannot safely assume they will recover when stressors are reduced, so prevention is a far more robust management strategy than seeking a cure for degraded systems.},

	abstract = {Most spatial marine management techniques (e.g., marine protected areas) draw stationary boundaries around often mobile marine features, animals, or resource users. While these approaches can work for relatively stationary marine resources, to be most effective marine management must be as ﬂuid in space and time as the resources and users we aim to manage. Instead, a shift towards dynamic ocean management is suggested, deﬁned as management that rapidly changes in space and time in response to changes in the ocean and its users through the integration of near real-time biological, oceanographic, social and/or economic data. Dynamic management can reﬁne the temporal and spatial scale of managed areas, thereby better balancing ecological and economic objectives. Temperature dependent habitat of a hypothetical mobile marine species was simulated to show the efﬁciency of dynamic management, ﬁnding that 82.0 to 34.2 percent less area needed to be managed using a dynamic approach. Dynamic management further complements existing management by increasing the speed at which decisions are implemented using predeﬁned protocols. With advances in data collection and sharing, particularly in remote sensing, animal tracking, and mobile technology, managers are poised to apply dynamic management across numerous marine sectors. Existing examples demonstrate that dynamic management can successfully allow managers to respond rapidly to changes on-the-water, however to implement dynamic ocean management widely, several gaps must be ﬁlled. These include enhancing legal instruments, incorporating ecological and socioeconomic considerations simultaneously, developing ‘out-of-the-box’ platforms to serve dynamic management data to users, and developing applications broadly across additional marine resource sectors. \& 2015 The Authors.

	abstract = {Spatial management measures are currently being used to manage bycatch and discards, given the spatial heterogeneity of ﬁsh distributions. However, permanent ﬁshing closures are often poorly implemented, unresponsive to stock dynamics and do not achieve their management objectives. Recently, real-time spatial management tools for managing bycatch and discards implemented under either a comanagement or self-governance approach have been introduced in Europe and the US. Real-time catch and discard information is shared among ﬁshers to incentivise and encourage vessels to leave areas of high bycatch. Here, the similarities and differences, in governance, implementation and management of ten real-time spatial management systems from across Europe and the US are reviewed. A framework is developed to characterize the attributes associated with voluntary, private and regulatory real-time spatial management tools. Challenges and management practices in the different case studies are reviewed providing insights for designing these spatial management tools. The results illustrate that real-time spatial management approaches can create incentives for ﬁshers to develop, use and share information and technology to avoid undesired catch. Compared with Europe, the US has developed spatial management tools with more truly real-time mechanisms and with greater involvement of the ﬁshing industry in designing and operating the tools.},

In the first quarter of each calendar year from 1994 to 2006, the majority of shallow longline sets and associated loggerhead turtle bycatch were above 28° N, which corresponds to the area near the North Pacific Subtropical Frontal Zone. Based on the thermal ranges of bycatch, sets and the satellite-tagged turtles, it was recommended that shallow sets should only be deployed in waters south of the 18.5°C ({\textasciitilde}65.5°F) isotherm to decrease loggerhead turtle bycatch. This recommendation formed the basis for the TurtleWatch tool, a map providing up-to-date information about the thermal habitat of loggerhead sea turtles in the Pacific Ocean north of the Hawaiin Islands. TurtleWatch was released to fishers and managers in electronic and paper formats on December 26, 2006, to assist in decision making during the first quarter of 2007. Fishery information from 2007 was later compared with data for the years 2005 to 2006 to assess the response of the fishery to TurtleWatch. The observed fleet movement during the first quarter of 2007 was to the north of the 18.5°C ({\textasciitilde}65.5°F) isotherm (i.e. in the area recommended for avoidance by the TurtleWatch product) with increased effort and lower bycatch rates. We discuss possible reasons for this decrease in turtle bycatch north of the frontal zone together with future research directions which may lead to refinement of the TurtleWatch product.},

These regulatory practices are neither feasible nor desirable for many fisheries, and have failed to conserve fishery stocks in other fisheries. Marine reserves may be an effective alternative management strategy for some fisheries. Here we develop a dynamic model of marine reserves applicable to inshore fisheries. In contrast to previous models of reserves, the model is fully dynamic and provides information on both equilibrium conditions and the path to equilibrium. A simulation model based on red snapper data from the Gulf of Mexico is presented. The simulation results suggest that marine reserves can sustain or increase yields for moderate to heavily fished fisheries but will probably not improve yields for lightly fished fisheries.},

	abstract = {Southern blueﬁn tuna (SBT), Thunnus maccoyii (Castelnau), is a quota-managed species that makes annual winter migrations to the Tasman Sea oﬀ south-eastern Australia. During this period it interacts with a year-round tropical tuna longline ﬁshery (Eastern Tuna and Billﬁsh Fishery, ETBF). ETBF managers seek to minimise the bycatch of SBT by commercial ETBF longline ﬁshers with limited or no SBT quota through spatial restrictions. Access to areas where SBT are believed to be present is restricted to ﬁshers holding SBT quota. A temperature-based SBT habitat model was developed to provide managers with an estimate of tuna distribution upon which to base their decisions about placement of management boundaries. Adult SBT temperature preferences were determined using pop-up satellite archival tags. The near real-time predicted location of SBT was determined by matching temperature preferences to satellite sea surface temperature data and vertical temperature data from an oceanographic model. Regular reports detailing the location of temperature-based SBT habitat were produced during the period of the ETBF ﬁshing season when interactions with SBT occur. The SBT habitat model included: (i) predictions based on the current vertical structure of the ocean; (ii) seasonally adjusted temperature preference data for the 60 calendar days centred on the prediction date; and (iii) development of a temperaturebased SBT habitat climatology that allowed visualisation of the expected change in the distribution of the SBT habitat zones throughout the season. At the conclusion of the ﬁshing season an automated method for placing management boundaries was compared with the subjective approach used by managers. Applying this automated procedure to the habitat predictions enabled an investigation of the eﬀects of setting management boundaries using old data and updating management boundaries infrequently. Direct comparison with the management boundaries allowed an evaluation of the eﬃciency and biases produced by this aspect of the ﬁshery management process. Near real-time ﬁshery management continues to be a realistic prospect that new scientiﬁc approaches using novel tools can support and advance.},

In eastern Australian waters, southern bluefin tuna (SBT, Thunnus maccoyii) are a quota-limited species in a multispecies longline fishery; minimizing capture by nonquota holders is an important management concern. A habitat preference model (conditioned with electronic tag data) coupled with ocean reanalysis data has been used since 2003 to generate real-time predicted maps of SBT distribution (nowcasts). These maps are used by fishery managers to restrict fisher access to areas with high predicted SBT distribution. Here we use the coupled ocean–atmosphere model, POAMA (predictive ocean atmosphere model for Australia), and a habitat model to forecast SBT distribution at lead times of up to 4 months. These forecasts are comparable with nowcasts derived from the operational system, and show skill in predicting SBT habitat boundaries out to lead-times of 3–4 months. For this fishery, seasonal forecasts can provide managers and fishers with valuable insights into future habitat distributions for the upcoming months, to better inform operational decisions.},

Between 2000 and 2009, in-season bycatch closures of prime scallop grounds resulted in economic losses over US\$100 million. To address this constraint, we collaborated with the scallop fishing industry to implement a bycatch avoidance program in the Nantucket Lightship harvest area in 2010. Vessels shared near real-time location information about bycatch amounts during fishing activities. We compiled the information, identified bycatch hotspots, and provided daily advisories to vessels on the fishing grounds. Catch per tow of Yellowtail and fishing effort in high bycatch regions significantly declined after the fleet received the advisories. The fleet harvested the target scallop allocation worth US\$40 million while catching only 32\% of the Yellowtail bycatch limit. This program continues as a collaborative, iterative approach to bycatch reduction that balances fleet objectives with conservation constraints.},

Measures to understand and avoid Atlantic sturgeon that take into consideration the dynamic nature of their habitat may reduce harmful interactions. In this study, we matched ﬁsheries independent biotelemetry observations of Atlantic sturgeon with daily satellite observations to construct a time resolved spatial distribution model of Atlantic sturgeon. We determined that depth, day-of-year, sea surface temperature, and light absorption by seawater were the most important predictors of Atlantic sturgeon occurrence. Demographic factors, such as sex and river-of-origin were of secondary importance. We found strong spatial differences in spring and fall migration patterns, when anthropogenic interactions peak. Our cross-validated models correctly identiﬁed {\textgreater} 88\% of biotelemetry observations in our study region. Our models also correctly identiﬁed \$64\% of bycatch observations throughout the year. However, during their migrations, when harmful interactions were highest, our models correctly identiﬁed \$90\% of ﬁsheries dependent observations. We suggest that this model can be used for guidance to managers and stakeholders to reduce interactions with this highly imperiled species, thereby enhancing conservation and recovery efforts.},

	abstract = {Fishery-­dependent data are integral to sustainable fisheries management. A paucity of fishery data leads to uncertainty about stock status, which may compromise and threaten the economic and food security of the users dependent upon that stock and increase the chances of overfishing. Recent developments in the technology available to collect, manage and analyse fishery-­relevant data provide a suite of possible solutions to update and modernize fisheries data systems and greatly expand data collection and analysis. Yet, despite the proliferation of relevant consumer technology, integration of technologically advanced data systems into fisheries management remains the exception rather than the rule. In this study, we describe the current status, challenges and future directions of high-t­ech data systems in fisheries management in order to understand what has limited their adoption. By reviewing the application of fishery-­dependent data technology in multiple fisheries sectors globally, we show that innovation is stagnating as a result of lack of trust and cooperation between fishers and managers. We propose a solution based on a transdisciplinary approach to fishery management that emphasizes the need for collaborative problem-s­ olving among stakeholders. In our proposed system, data feedbacks are a key component to effective fishery data systems, ensuring that fishers and managers collect, have access to and benefit from fisheries data as they work towards a mutually agreed-­upon goal. A new approach to fisheries data systems will promote innovation to increase data coverage, accuracy and resolution, while reducing costs and allowing adaptive, responsive, near real-­time management decision-­making to improve fisheries outcomes.},

Our paper aims to investigate the global patterns of such impacts by projecting the distributional ranges of a sample of 1066 exploited marine fish and invertebrates for 2050 using a newly developed dynamic bioclimate envelope model. Our projections show that climate change may lead to numerous local extinction in the sub-polar regions, the tropics and semi-enclosed seas. Simultaneously, species invasion is projected to be most intense in the Arctic and the Southern Ocean. Together, they result in dramatic species turnovers of over 60\% of the present biodiversity, implying ecological disturbances that potentially disrupt ecosystem services. Our projections can be viewed as a set of hypothesis for future analytical and empirical studies.},

	abstract = {1 Climate change has been inducing range shifts for many species as they follow their suitable climate space and further shifts are projected. Whether species will be able to colonize regions where climate conditions become suitable, so-called ‘new climate space’, depends on species traits and habitat fragmentation. 2 By combining bioclimate envelope models with dispersal models, we identified areas where the spatial cohesion of the ecosystem pattern is expected to be insufficient to allow colonization of new climate space. 3 For each of three ecosystem types, three species were selected that showed a shift in suitable climate space and differed in habitat fragmentation sensitivity. 4 For the 2020 and 2050 time slices, the amount of climatically suitable habitat in northwest Europe diminished for all studied species. Additionally, significant portions of new suitable habitat could not be colonized because of isolation. Together, this will result in a decline in the amount of suitable habitat protected in Natura 2000 sites. 5 We develop several adaptation strategies to combat this problem: (i) link isolated habitat that is within a new suitable climate zone to the nearest climate-proof network; (ii) increase colonizing capacity in the overlap zone, the part of a network that remains suitable in successive time frames; (iii) optimize sustainable networks in climate refugia, the part of a species’ range where the climate remains stable. 6 Synthesis and applications. Following the method described in this study, we can identify those sites across Europe where ecosystem patterns are not cohesive enough to accommodate species’ responses to climate change. The best locations for climate corridors where improving connectivity is most urgent and potential gain is highest can then be pinpointed.},

	abstract = {The implementation of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) is ultimately a social endeavour to sustain or improve human well-being via the conservation of marine ecosystems. The degree to which ecological gains are realised can depend upon how economic, ecological and social costs (negative impacts) and beneﬁts (positive impacts) are included in the designation and management process. Without the support of key stakeholder groups whose user rights have been affected by the creation of an MPA, human impacts cannot be reduced. This study analyses a three year dataset to understand the themes associated with the economic, environmental and social costs and beneﬁts of an MPA in Lyme Bay, United Kingdom (UK) following its establishment in 2008. Methodologically, the paper presents an ecosystem based management framework for analysing costs and beneﬁts. Two hundred and forty one individuals were interviewed via questionnaire between 2008 and 2010 to determine perceptions and the level of support towards the MPA. Results reveal that despite the contentious manner in which this MPA was established, support for the MPA is strong amongst the majority of stakeholder groups. The level of support and the reasons given for support vary between stakeholder groups. Overall, the stakeholders perceive the social, economic and environmental beneﬁts of the MPA to outweigh the perceived costs. There have been clear social costs of the MPA policy and these have been borne by mobile and static gear ﬁshermen and charter boat operators. Local support for this MPA bodes well for the development of a network of MPAs around the UK coast under the United Kingdom Marine and Coastal Access Act 2009. However, this initial optimism is at risk if stakeholder expectation is not managed and the management vacuum is not ﬁlled. Ó 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},
